--CUSTOMER RETENTION ANALYSIS

--1. Create a view that keeps visit logs of customers on a monthly basis. (For each log, three field is kept: Cust_id, Year, Month)
--Use such date functions. Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

CREATE VIEW customer_of_logs AS

SELECT	cust_id,
		YEAR (ORDER_DATE) [YEAR],
		MONTH (ORDER_DATE) [MONTH]
FROM	combined_table

ORDER BY 1,2,3 desc


--//////////////////////////////////


--2. Create a view that keeps the number of monthly visits by users. (Separately for all months from the business beginning)
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

CREATE VIEW monthly_of_visits AS

SELECT	Cust_id, [YEAR], [MONTH], COUNT(*) NUM_OF_LOG
FROM	customer_logs
GROUP BY Cust_id, [YEAR], [MONTH]


--//////////////////////////////////


--3. For each visit of customers, create the next month of the visit as a separate column.
--You can number the months with "DENSE_RANK" function.
--then create a new column for each month showing the next month using the numbering you have made. (use "LEAD" function.)
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

CREATE VIEW NEXT_of_VISIT AS 
SELECT *,
		LEAD(CURRENT_MONTH ) OVER (PARTITION BY Cust_id ORDER BY CURRENT_MONTH) NEXT_VISIT_MONTH
FROM 
(
SELECT  *,
		DENSE_RANK () OVER (ORDER BY [YEAR] , [MONTH]) CURRENT_MONTH
		
FROM	monthly_of_visits

--4. Calculate the monthly time gap between two consecutive visits by each customer.
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

CREATE VIEW time_gaps AS

SELECT *,
		NEXT_VISIT_MONTH - CURRENT_MONTH time_gaps
FROM	NEXT_of_VISIT

--/////////////////////////////////////////
--5.Categorise customers using time gaps. Choose the most fitted labeling model for you.
--  For example: 
--	Labeled as churn if the customer hasn't made another purchase in the months since they made their first purchase.
--	Labeled as regular if the customer has made a purchase every month.
--  Etc.
SELECT * FROM time_gaps

--MONTH-WÝSE RETENTÝON RATE


--Find month-by-month customer retention rate  since the start of the business.


--1. Find the number of customers retained month-wise. (You can use time gaps)
--Use Time Gaps

SELECT	DISTINCT cust_id, [YEAR],
		[MONTH],
		CURRENT_MONTH,
		NEXT_VISIT_MONTH,
		time_gaps,

FROM	time_gaps
where	time_gaps =1
ORDER BY cust_id, YEAR,MONTH

--//////////////////////


--2. Calculate the month-wise retention rate.

--Basic formula: o	Month-Wise Retention Rate = 1.0 * Total Number of Customers in The Previous Month / Number of Customers Retained in The Next Nonth

--It is easier to divide the operations into parts rather than in a single ad-hoc query. It is recommended to use View. 
--You can also use CTE or Subquery if you want.

--You should pay attention to the join type and join columns between your views or tables.
